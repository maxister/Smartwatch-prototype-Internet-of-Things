We build our smartwatch under the environment of ESP8266. We use Python to write our program.

In our first lab, we connect LEDs to the board to test the transmission of signals between the board and other components.

1. We writ a program to blink the LED with messages encoded by morse code. In morse code, each letter is represented by a series of dots (short tones) and dashes (long tones). For dots, the LED should blink at around twice the speed of dashes to represent the string.

2. In addition,we write a program to blink two separate LEDs simultaneously  at two different rates (e.g. blink LED 1 at 100 ms, LED 2 at 500 ms).
